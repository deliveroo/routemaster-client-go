## Contributing Code

    go get -u github.com/deliveroo/routemaster-client-go

Make a branch under a namespace with this format: `${first initial}${last
name}/${branch name}`. For example:

    git checkout -b jgibb/rocks`

Make sure the tests pass:

    make test

Make your change, with new passing tests. Make sure you've run `go fmt`.

Others will give constructive feedback.  This is a time for discussion and
improvements, and making the necessary changes will be required before we can
merge the contribution.
